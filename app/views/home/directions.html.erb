      <h2>Oh no! You've been stranded!</h2>
      <p>Last night, you were starting to plan out your English essay, when you were suddenly whisked away to a deserted island.</p>
      <p>You'll need to communicate with your friends on a ship nearby to direct them towards your location. Just as an essay uses evidence to steer readers towards a claim, you'll need to provide clues to steer your friends to your island.</p> 
      <p>Good clues will get your rescued. Poor clues will leave you stranded.</p>
      <hr>

      <h2>Set Up</h2>
      <p>You will need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>An Outline ID</b>: 
          <p>Log in or create an account. Click on 'Outlines.' Click on 'Add an Outline.'</p>
          <p>Give your outline a name. For each outline, provide two quotations that you will use as evidence, provide one 'Close Call' quotation (a quotation tht somewhat supports your claim, but not as well as your other two quotes), and provide one 'Red Herring' quotation (a quotation that does not support your claim AT ALL!).</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>A Teammate</b>:
          <p>You will need at least one person to play on your team.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>An Opponent</b>:
          <p>You will need another player with their own outline id and teammate.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Press the 'Play' button on the home screen.</li> 
        <li>Enter your outline id and your opponent's outline id. Press 'Sart Game!'</li>
        <li>A game board will be generated with 16 tiles.</li>
        <li>Stranded clue givers may select the 'Go to Islander's View' link on the top right of the page, which will color each tile based on the type of evidence it contains.
          <ul>
            <li>Blue Tiles = Evidence that the blue team must select in order to win.</li>
            <li>Green Tiles = Evidence that the green team must select in order to win.</li>
            <li>Yellow Tiles = Close call evidence</li>
            <li>Red Tiles = Red herring evidence</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      <li>When cluegivers are ready to give clues, click on the 'Go to Captain's View' link on the top right of the page so that teammates who are guessing cannot see the tile colors.</li>
      <li>The team to go first is randomly selected by the game. Look at the top left of the game page to see whose turn it is.</li>
      </ol>
      <hr>

      <h2>Game Play</h2>
      <p>Stranded islanders give single sentence clues to their teammates followed by a number, representing the number of quotes on the board that support that claim. For example: <blockquote><b>"In Lord of the Flies, William Golding portrays Simon as a Christ-like figure. Two."</b></blockquote>
      </p>The single sentence should be similar to an argumentative claim that would begin a body paragraph in your essay. The goal is to get your teammate to select to the one or two pieces of evidence belonging to a given claim clue.</p>
      <p>A teammate has two guesses per clue. If the teammate selects a red herring tile on the first guess, they lose their second guess, and the other team begins their turn.</p>
      <p>If your claim clue does not lead your teammate to the evidence you were hoping for them to guess, it is time to reframe your claim! Or consider how another claim entirely might work for different groupings of evidence. </p>
      <hr>

      <h2>Win Scenario</h2>
      <p>The first team to get their teammate(s) to guess all four pieces of evidence wins!</p>
     <hr>

      <h2>Post-Game Reflections . . . the most important part!</h2>
      <p>After the game ends, consider how well your teammate(s) were able to guess your evidence from your claim clues.Confer with your partner(s) to help answer the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which claims led to successful guesses, and which did not? Why?</li>
        <li>Could your claims be re-worded to better point to your evidence?
        <li>Was there evidence on the board that better fit your claim? Should you consider changing up the evidence you will use to support your claims?</li>
      </ul>
